<ids_framework>
## IDS: Identify, Discuss, Solve

The core of L10 meetings. 60 minutes dedicated to solving issues.

**Identify:** Name the real issue (not symptoms)
**Discuss:** Everyone contributes perspective (timebox discussions)
**Solve:** Reach a decision with clear next steps

**Rules:**
- Tackle issues in priority order
- One issue at a time
- Don't move on until solved or delegated
- Unsolved issues go back to list for next week
</ids_framework>

<accountability_structure>
## WHO / WHAT / WHEN

Every commitment must have:

**WHO:** Single person responsible (never "the team")
**WHAT:** Specific, measurable action
**WHEN:** Deadline (specific date or "by next meeting")

**Good Example:**
- WHO: Sarah
- WHAT: Implement Stripe webhook handler for subscription cancellations
- WHEN: Friday, Dec 13

**Bad Example:**
- WHO: Engineering team
- WHAT: Fix the payment issues
- WHEN: Soon
