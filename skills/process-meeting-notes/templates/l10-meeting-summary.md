**To-Dos Section (Most Important):**
- Every to-do MUST have a single owner (never "team" or multiple people)
- Due dates should be specific (not "soon" or "ASAP")
- Link to GitHub issues when created
- If no deadline was mentioned, default to "Before Next Meeting"

**IDS Section:**
- Only include issues that were actually SOLVED in the meeting
- Unsolved issues become "Outstanding Questions"
- Each issue should have a clear resolution or next step

**Scorecard/Rock Review:**
- Only include if these were actually discussed
- It's okay to mark section as "N/A - Not discussed this meeting"
