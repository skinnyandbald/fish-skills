# /vercel-react-best-practices

45 React and Next.js performance optimization rules from Vercel Engineering, organized by impact priority.

## Usage

This is a **passive skill** — it activates automatically when you're writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code. You can also invoke it directly:

```
/vercel-react-best-practices
```

## What It Covers

| Priority | Category | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Eliminating Waterfalls | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Bundle Size Optimization | CRITICAL |
| 3 | Server-Side Performance | HIGH |
| 4 | Client-Side Data Fetching | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| 5 | Re-render Optimization | MEDIUM |
| 6 | Rendering Performance | MEDIUM |
| 7 | JavaScript Performance | LOW-MEDIUM |
| 8 | Advanced Patterns | LOW |

## Structure

- `SKILL.md` — Quick reference with all 45 rules summarized
- `rules/` — Individual rule files with detailed explanations and code examples
- `AGENTS.md` — Full compiled guide with all rules expanded

Each rule file contains: explanation, incorrect code example, correct code example, and references.

## Prerequisites

- None. This is a reference skill with no external dependencies.

## Customization

The rules are static — edit individual files in `rules/` to add project-specific exceptions or notes.
