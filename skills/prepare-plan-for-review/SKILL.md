# Generate Plan Peer Review Prompt

## Step 1: Resolve the plan path

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a path, resolve it to its **absolute path**. If no argument was provided, ask which plan to review.

- If it's a **file**, use the absolute file path directly.
- If it's a **directory**, use the absolute directory path with a trailing `/`. Cursor will read all files in it — no need to enumerate individual files.
- If the path is relative, resolve it to absolute.

Verify the path exists.

## Step 2: Load or detect the project's tech stack

**Check for cached stack profile first:** Read `.claude/stack-profile.md` in the project root. If it exists, use it directly — skip detection entirely.

**If no cache exists**, detect the stack by reading `package.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, and config files (`tsconfig.json`, `next.config.*`, `biome.json`, etc.) to identify:

- **Framework** (e.g. Next.js 16, Remix, Express, FastAPI, Rails)
- **Language** (e.g. TypeScript 5.9, Python 3.12)
- **Database** (e.g. Supabase/PostgreSQL, Prisma, Drizzle, MongoDB)
- **API layer** (e.g. tRPC, REST, GraphQL)
- **Auth** (e.g. Supabase Auth, Auth.js, Clerk)
- **Validation** (e.g. Zod, Yup, io-ts)
- **Testing** (e.g. Vitest, Jest, Playwright, agent-browser)
- **Linting/Formatting** (e.g. Biome, ESLint+Prettier)
- **UI** (e.g. Tailwind, Radix, shadcn/ui, MUI)
- **Key patterns** (e.g. RSC, Server Actions, App Router)

Then **save the result** to `.claude/stack-profile.md` with this format:

```markdown
# Stack Profile
<!-- Auto-generated by /prepare-plan-for-review. Edit to customize. -->

## Tech Stack
Next.js 16, TypeScript 5.9, tRPC 11, Supabase, Zod 4, Vitest, Tailwind 4

## Analysis Scope
- Backend: tRPC procedures, Supabase database operations, auth flows
- Frontend: React Server Components, Client Components, form validation with Zod
- Integration: End-to-end type safety, API contract validation

## Best Practices
- TypeScript strict mode compliance (no 'any' types)
- Server Component usage prioritized over Client Components
- tRPC end-to-end type safety implementation
- Zod schema validation in both client and server
- Supabase RLS policies and migration best practices

## Analysis Format
- Use TypeScript code examples matching the project's patterns
- Reference specific files: `src/server/api/routers/*.ts`, `src/app/*/page.tsx`
- Include test file examples: `__tests__/*`, `*.test.ts`
- Provide before/after code comparisons where applicable
```

Tell the user the profile was saved and can be edited at `.claude/stack-profile.md` if they want to tweak it.

Use the detected/cached values to fill in all placeholders below.

## Step 3: Output the prompt

Your output MUST start with a line containing ONLY three backticks, then the prompt content, then end with a line containing ONLY three backticks. Like this:

\`\`\`
[prompt content here]
\`\`\`

This is critical — the user needs to see the literal backtick fences to know where to copy from and to.

Here is the template to fill in and output:

You are an AI development consultant specializing in Test-Driven Development implementation. Conduct a comprehensive end-to-end TDD implementation analysis of this proposed plan:

**TECH STACK:** <TECH STACK — one-liner, e.g. "Next.js 16, TypeScript 5.9, tRPC 11, Supabase, Zod 4, Vitest, Tailwind 4">

**ANALYSIS SCOPE:**
<ANALYSIS SCOPE — 3-5 bullet points derived from the detected stack, e.g.:
- Backend: tRPC procedures, Supabase database operations, auth flows
- Frontend: React Server Components, Client Components, form validation with Zod
- Integration: End-to-end type safety, API contract validation>

**REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:**
1. **Test Coverage Assessment** (30-40% of analysis):
   - Unit tests: procedures, utility functions, validation schemas
   - Integration tests: Database operations, auth flows
   - E2E tests: Complete user journeys
   - Coverage gaps with specific file/function references

2. **TDD Cycle Compliance Review** (25-30% of analysis):
   - Red phase: Failing tests written first with clear assertions
   - Green phase: Minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactor phase: Code improvement while maintaining test pass
   - Evidence of proper cycle adherence per feature

3. **Stack Best Practices Validation** (25-30% of analysis):
   <BEST PRACTICES — 4-6 bullet points specific to detected stack, e.g.:
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance (no 'any' types)
   - Server Component usage prioritized over Client Components
   - tRPC end-to-end type safety implementation
   - Zod schema validation in both client and server
   - Supabase RLS policies and migration best practices>

4. **Actionable Recommendations** (15-20% of analysis):
   - Specific code examples for missing tests
   - Implementation steps for TDD cycle improvements
   - Technology-specific optimization suggestions

**ANALYSIS FORMAT:**
<ANALYSIS FORMAT — 4-5 bullet points with file path patterns from the actual project, e.g.:
- Use TypeScript code examples matching the project's patterns
- Reference specific files: `src/server/api/routers/*.ts`, `src/app/*/page.tsx`
- Include test file examples: `__tests__/*`, `*.test.ts`
- Provide before/after code comparisons where applicable>
- DO NOT test the actual implemented codebase, you're purely giving feedback on the proposed plan

Plan: <FILE PATH TO PLAN>

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- 90%+ test coverage on critical paths
- Complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle evidence
- Zero TypeScript 'any' types in production code
- End-to-end type safety from database to UI
```

**IMPORTANT:** Replace ALL angle-bracket placeholders with real values. The output must be a clean, ready-to-copy prompt with no placeholders remaining.

After outputting the code block, tell the user it's ready to copy into Cursor.
